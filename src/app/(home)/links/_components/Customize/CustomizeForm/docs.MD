- linksChanged State

The linksChanged state is a boolean variable that tracks whether any changes have occurred in the links data, such as additions, deletions, or updates. It serves as a flag to indicate if there have been modifications to the links before submitting the form or taking certain actions based on the changes.

Usage
linksChanged is initially set to false to indicate no changes.

When a change occurs in the links (e.g., adding a new link, deleting a link, or modifying a link), setLinksChanged(true) is called to update the state and indicate that modifications have taken place.

This state is often used in conjunction with form submissions or other actions to determine whether changes have been made and if certain actions need to be triggered accordingly.
